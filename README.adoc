This demonstrates a configuration issue with `spring-data-gemfire`.
The requirement is for a master application that launches worker nodes as copies of itself with the `worker` profile
activated. Each worker has a peer cache, but the master node does not require Gemfire resources.

The SDG configuration is basically:

```java
@Profile("worker")
@Configuration
@PeerCacheApplication
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions
public class GemfireConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public GemfireTemplate gemfireTemplate(org.apache.geode.cache.Region region) {
        GemfireTemplate template = new GemfireTemplate(region);
        return template;
    }
}
```

The observed behavior is when this class is implicitly or explicitly imported by the Main class, the cache and region
 do not get created, resulting in `org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying
 bean of type 'org.apache.geode.cache.Region<?, ?>' available`


To demonstrate this, activate the `worker` profile in application.properties.

Including the same configuration in the main application class (as an inner class here) works as expected, but this
should not be required.

To demonstrate this, activate the `works` proflie in application.properties.
